# Commutify
Commutify is a responsive web application that allows Spotify users to create new music playlists based on the user's inputed commute time and preferred artist. 

The React web app uses Spotify's API to make HTTP requests to retrieve a Spotify user's current playlists, get artist tracks and update a user's Spotify account once a new playlist has been made. 

In order for the server on PORT 8888 to communicate with Spotify's API, a client ID and client secret key are required but are also confidential. These are provided by Spotify once you sign up with Spotify for Developers.
